# Meta Box Schema

WIP: Schema definition for Meta Box, useful for code completion and validation.

Schema Links:

Meta Box
```
https://schemas.metabox.io/field-group.json
```

Settings Page
```
https://schemas.metabox.io/settings-page.json
```

Relationships
```
https://schemas.metabox.io/relationships.json
```

## Development

During development, you'll want to use local path so that you can test the schema with your local changes.

1. Clone this repository
1. Replace path to `schema.json` with your local path (e.g. `file:///home/tan/projects/schema/schema.json`)
